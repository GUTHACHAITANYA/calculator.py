üìå Project Description

This project is a web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and Python (Flask framework). It provides a simple and interactive interface for performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The application has a clean and user-friendly design, resembling a real calculator with number buttons (0‚Äì9), operators (+, -, √ó, √∑), decimal point, clear all (C), and backspace (‚å´) functionality. Users can input expressions by clicking the buttons, and the result is computed by the Flask backend using Python.
